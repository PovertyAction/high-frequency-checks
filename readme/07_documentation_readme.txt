DOCUMENTATION
++++++++++++++++

This folder is designed to store any additional documentation about the HFCs process. Below are some suggestions of useful documentation to include:

- Explanation of protocols

Clearly describe the system in place for conducting HFCs. Who is responsible for maintaining the inputs sheet and the do files? Who is responsible for downloading data and running it through the checks? Who is responsible for reading the output and reporting out to the field when necessary? Delegating each task to an individual or team of individuals at the very start will ensure that data quality checks are conducted consistently and rigorously.

- Explanation of new checks

If any new checks are added beyond those included in the IPA HFC package, include a document that explains what they do and how they should be run.

- Log of data issues & field reports

Use some sort of documentation system to record the issues flagged by the HFCs, the feedback received from the field team, and what (if any) actions were taken as a result.
