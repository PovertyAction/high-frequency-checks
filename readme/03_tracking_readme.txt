Tracking
++++++++++++++++

This folder is designed to store any do files and ouput that track survey progress during the data collection phase. For example, if your project conducted a tracking survey prior to the start of actual data collection, it may be useful to match the tracking data to incoming survey data in order to gauge how many households have been reached, monitor completion rates by region or enumerator, etc. 

Similarly, it is a good idea to maintain a list of households that have yet to be surveyed, so that during data collection you can communicate with the field teams assigned to certain households and ensure they have in fact completed an interview for that household (or else provided an explanation for why the survey could not be completed).
