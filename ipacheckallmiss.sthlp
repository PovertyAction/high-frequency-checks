{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckallmiss} Check that no variables have only missing values, where missing indicates
a skip. This could mean that the routing of the survey program was incorrectly programmed. 
Note that IPA's Data Management System changes values to missing as specified in the input sheet 
(i.e. -999 = .d), which will also be considered missing in this check.

{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
{cmd:ipacheckallmiss} is one of the checks run in IPA's high frequency checks. 
It can be run within IPA's Data Management System, where inputs are entered into an .xlsm file 
and outputs are formatted in a .xlsx file. See {help ipacheck} for more details on how to use the Data Management System.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
In IPA's master_check.do file created when using the Data Management System, the inputs you enter into
hfc_inputs.xlsm are used as globals through {cmd:ipacheckimport} to fill in this command:
